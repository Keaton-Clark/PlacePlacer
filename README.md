Unity VR experience that allows the user to visualize large sets of 4 dimensional data (x, y, z, t)

The data set I used was the 2022 r/place social experiment which consisted of a grid of 2,000 by 2,000 tiles on a canvas. For 4 days after April 4th, each Reddit account could palce one tile every 5 minutes
